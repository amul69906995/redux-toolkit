# Redux Boilerplate and Frontend State Management Journey

This repository demonstrates the progression of frontend state management techniques, starting from basic React state management (`useState` and `useEffect`) to Redux with `createAsyncThunk`, and finally to `RTK Query` for efficient server-state management. Below is a detailed breakdown of the approach:

---

## 1. **Normal State Management (React State)**

Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` for local component state.

### Pros:
- Simple to implement.
- Works well for small apps.

### Cons:
- Becomes cumbersome as the app scales.
- Lacks global state management.
- Can lead to prop drilling.

---

## 2. **Redux with `createSlice` and `createAsyncThunk`**

State management with Redux Toolkit using `createSlice` for reducers and `createAsyncThunk` for handling asynchronous actions.

### Features:
- Centralized state for better organization.
- Async state handling with `createAsyncThunk` (e.g., API calls).
- Improved developer experience with less boilerplate compared to traditional Redux.

### Cons:
- While streamlined, managing async logic manually can become repetitive.

---

## 3. **RTK Query (Redux Toolkit Query)**

A powerful data-fetching and caching library built into Redux Toolkit.

### Features:
- Automatically fetch, cache, and update data with minimal boilerplate.
- Simplified integration with backend APIs.
- Built-in query and mutation hooks.
- Server state management made easy with automatic refetching and cache invalidation.

### Cons:
- Primarily focused on server state; not ideal for complex local state.

## Why Use This Repository?

This repository is designed as a step-by-step guide for learning and implementing:

1. **Basic State Management**: Start with React's local state for simple applications.
2. **Scalable Redux Solution**: Transition to Redux Toolkit with `createAsyncThunk` for apps requiring centralized state and async logic.
3. **Advanced Server State Handling**: Harness the power of RTK Query for efficient, declarative server state management.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux Toolkit.
- **Backend**: Mock API for demonstration purposes.

---

## State Management Techniques Covered

1. **React State**: `useState`, `useEffect`.
2. **Redux Toolkit**: `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`.
3. **RTK Query**: Built-in API service for data fetching and server state management.
